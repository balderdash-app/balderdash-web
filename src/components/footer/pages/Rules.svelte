		Balderdash is a popular board game where players concoct convincing but false responses to a
		prompt. The game revolves around the dynamic of a "prompt" and "response" pairs that depend on
		the category -- e.g. if the category is "rare words", then the prompt will be a word and the
		response will be the definition of that word, whereas in the context of film taglines the prompt
		will be a movie title and the response will be the tagline.

	<p>The game is played in rounds where one person is the dasher and all others are guessers</p>
	<br class="pb-5" />
	<p>
		The dasher selects a prompt (e.g. rare word, acronym, etc) and the guessers must find the
		matching response (e.g. definition)
	</p>
	<br class="pb-5" />
	<p>
		The guessers must submit their answers within a pre-defined time limit, if they do not, then
		they will still be able to participate in the game by voting for other answers
	</p>
	<br class="pb-5" />
	<p>
		Guessers can choose to submit a "double bluff" response -- if they do so, then every vote that
		their submission receives will gain 2 points instead of the usual 1, however, if their response
		does not get a single vote, then they will lose 3 points. Note that if a double-bluff submission
		is marked as "correct" by the dasher, then the double-bluff flag has no effect, it is only
		applicable to phony answers.
	</p>
	<br class="pb-5" />
	<p>
		Once all responses are submitted, the dasher marks those that match the true response (e.g. the
		correct word definition)
	</p>
	<br class="pb-5" />
	<p>
		Next, all wrong responses along with a single correct one are presented to the guessers in
		random order and they must find the correct one.
