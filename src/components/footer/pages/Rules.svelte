	<p>The game is played in rounds where one person is the dasher and all others are guessers</p>
	<br class="pb-5" />
	<p>
		The dasher selects a prompt (e.g. rare word, acronym, etc) and the guessers must find the
		matching response (e.g. definition)
	</p>
	<br class="pb-5" />
	<p>
		The guessers must submit their answers within a pre-defined time limit, if they do not, then a
		random response will be submitted on their behalf
	</p>
	<br class="pb-5" />
	<p>
		Once all responses are submitted, the dasher marks those that match the true response (e.g. the
		correct word definition)
	</p>
	<br class="pb-5" />
	<p>
		Next, all wrong responses along with a single correct one are presented to the guessers in
		random order and they must find the correct one.
