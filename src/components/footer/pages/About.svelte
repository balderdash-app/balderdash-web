        This website was built by an independent developer who loves Balderdash and
        who wanted to be able to play it online with his friends and family. If you've
        stumbled upon this web app online, then you are also welcome to play it as much
        as you like. I'm also happy for you to share this app with your friends too.

        I have no intentions (or legal right) to put it behind a paywall, serve ads
        or monetize it in any way.

        If you have any suggestions for how to make this app better, please let me know
        by submitting feedback after finishing a game (you'll be asked to do that) or by
        going into the "Contact" section in the footer.
